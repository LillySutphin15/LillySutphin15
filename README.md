## Hello! My name is Lilly Sutphin!
I enjoy working on computers and love to physically fix them. I enjoy coding too but mostly just python over all the other languages.
I hope to one day be able to do one of the two as a job. Being able to work on technology is very fun for me because I can learn how it all works.
I have had a ton of fun coding with python. I made a "Choose your own adventure" with python in a class I had but lost the code unfortunately :(. 
But again I would love to work on or with computers for a job in the future.
